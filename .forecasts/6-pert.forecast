PERT forecasts accept a minimum, a maximum, and a mode. 

Examples where PERT forecasts make sense:

1. Project Management: Estimating the time required to complete a project where there is uncertainty in task durations.
2. Software Development: Predicting the time needed to develop a new feature or fix a bug when there are varying levels of complexity.
3. Construction: Estimating the duration of construction projects where there are uncertainties in material delivery and labor availability.
4. Research and Development: Forecasting the time to develop a new product or technology where there are unknowns in the research process.
5. Event Planning: Estimating the time required to organize an event where there are uncertainties in vendor availability and logistics.

In these scenarios, PERT helps in providing a more realistic estimate by considering the best-case, worst-case, and most likely durations.
