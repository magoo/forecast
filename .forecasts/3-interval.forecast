You choose an upper and lower boundary (min and max) and provide a confidence that the actual number will land equal to, or between, these numbers.

This is an interval forecast, similar to the "Jelly Beans in a Jar" forecast. 

More examples of situations where an interval forecast might be used include:

1. Estimating the number of attendees at an event, such as a conference or concert.
2. Predicting the range of sales for a new product launch.
3. Forecasting the amount of rainfall in a specific region over a given period.
4. Determining the range of possible stock prices for a company over the next quarter.
5. Estimating the time it will take to complete a project or task.
